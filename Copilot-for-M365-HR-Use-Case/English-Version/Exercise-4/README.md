Hi Everyone,

Welcome to the Exercise 4 Compose an email offer letter using Copilot in Outlook

To perform this Exercise you need to have download the file in the folder "File-to-download-for-the-Exercise"

Instruction: 

1) You have download the file locally now we need to add it to your OneDrive Account to be able to request it with Copilot.

2) Open and close the file in OneDrive to get it inside your Most Recently Used File list (MRU).

3) Connect you to M365 through a Web Browser (Edge is a recommended one) you can use the following link https://www.office.com  and connect to M365 with your account.

4) Open Microsoft Outlook Web.

5)Open a New email.

6)On the Message tab that opens, select Copilot in the ribbon. In the drop-down menu that appears, select Draft with Copilot.

7)In the body of the message, a Draft with Copilot window appears. Below the What do you want this email to say? message is a Generation options icon. Select this icon to see the options that Copilot provides when creating an email.

8)In the drop-down menu that appears, you see that you can change the Tone and Length of the email. You decide to start out by setting the Tone to Formal and the Length to Long. Select these settings (if necessary).

9)Enter the following prompt in the What do you want this email to say? field. When you do so, change [enter date] in the following prompt with the date you want. Select Generate to submit the request.

**I'm the HR Manager for the Graphic Design Institute. Please create an email offer letter to Patti Fernandez that offers her the position of Senior Animation Designer. Patti's planned start date is [enter date]. The starting salary is $67,022. Add a note that if Patti accepts the offer, she must sign and return the attached pdf copy of this offer.**

10)Review the first draft that Copilot creates. Note the salutation and complementary close, and the overall tone of the message. If you want to see how these features change when you change the tone and length of the email, then select the linked prompt at the top of the window ("I'm the HR Manager for the Graph...") to return to the Rewrite with Copilot window. Select the Generation options icon and change the Tone to Casual and the Length to Medium. Select Generate.

11)At this point, you're not sure whether you prefer the Formal or Casual tone. If you can't remember how the two messages appeared, make note of the Casual salutation and complementary close, and the quality of the message. Then select the back arrow until you return to the second Copilot draft that contained the employee benefits, which had the Formal tone. It's up to you whether you want to use Casual draft the Formal. Just make sure the current draft that you're looking at is the one you want.

12)In looking more closely at your selected draft, you noticed that you forgot to have Copilot mention some of the specific employee benefits at Graphic Design Institute. You want Copilot to review the Graphic Design Institute - Employee benefits file and provide a detailed summary of the employee benefits. Attaching a file referenced in a Copilot prompt uses the same attachment process as attaching a file to an email. Select the Attach file option in the Outlook ribbon. Locate the file on your OneDrive and attach it to the email.

13)Now enter the following request in the Anything you'd like to change? field to have Copilot extract the benefit information from the attached file, and then select the Send arrow at the end of the prompt field:

**This first draft looks good. However, I forgot to ask you to review the attached document and add some specific employee benefits in the email. Also include a note saying that Patti should review the attached document for more information on the full complement of benefits provided by Graphic Design Institute.**

14)What just happened when you tried to update the email draft based on this latest prompt? Chances are you received an error message indicating "Sorry, something went wrong. Copilot is working on it."The reason you received this error is that when you submit a change request to a draft, Copilot currently accepts only one change at a time per prompt. In this case, you asked for two changes - add some specific employee benefits and add a note about reviewing the attached document. Here's the current rule of thumb involving prompts when working in Copilot for Outlook:

When you submit your initial prompt, you can include multiple requests. For example, you could tell Copilot to include information about A, B, and C. In that case, it would generate a draft with all three items.
However, any subsequent prompts to amend a draft AFTER that initial prompt can only include one change request per prompt.

15)Given this requirement, you decide to break your previous request into two parts. This time, enter the following prompt, which is part one:

**This first draft looks good. However, I forgot to ask you to review the attached document and add some specific employee benefits in the email.**

16)If Copilot mentioned anything on its own about reviewing the attached document for more information on employee benefits (which it sometimes did in testing), then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, enter the following prompt:

**Add a note saying that Patti should review the attached document for more information on the full complement of benefits provided by Graphic Design Institute.**

17)Review these final changes. In doing so, you just noticed that the draft mentioned nothing about the offer being contingent upon the successful completion of a background check. Since the legal department at Graphic Design Institute wants a background check statement included in any offer letters, enter the following request in the Anything you'd like to change? field and then select the Send arrow at the end of the prompt field:

**Add a note towards the end of the email that this offer is contingent upon the successful completion of a background check and any other pre-employment screenings that may be required.**

18)After reviewing this change, you're happy with this final draft, so select the Keep it button.

19)Note how the message appears in the body of the email and the Rewrite with Copilot window disappears. Since you're no longer in Copilot draft mode, you can manually make any changes that you desire at this time. However, since you aren't sending this message, select the trash can (Discard) icon in the upper right corner of the email screen to delete the draft of this email.
